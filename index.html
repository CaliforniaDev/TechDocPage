      <p>Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. Its not a markup language
      either. <b>CSS is a style sheet language.</b>
      Css is what you use to selectively style html elements. For example,
      this CSS selects paragraph text, setting the color to red:</p>
  <code><span class="elements" class="border-left">p</span> {
    color: <span class="value">red</span>;
  } </code>
    <p>Let's try it out! Using a text editor, paste the three lines of CSS (above)
      into a new file. Save the file as
      <mark>style.css</mark>
      in a directory named <mark>styles</mark>.</p>
      <p>To Make the code work, we will neeed to apply this CSS (above) to your HTML document.
        Otherwise, the stlying won't change the appearance of the HTML.</p><br>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Open your <mark>index.html</mark> file. Paste the following line in the head
           (between the <mark>< head ></mark> and the <mark>< /head ></mark> tages):
       </li>
       <code> <!--white-space: normal -->
         <<span class="elements">link</span>
         <span class="attribute">href</span>=<span class="attribute-value">"styles/styles.css"</span>
         <span class="attribute">rel=</span><span class="attribute-value">"stylesheet"</span>>
       </code>
          <li>
            Save <mark>index.html</mark> and load it in your browser. You should see
              something like this:
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 10%;">
          <img alt="A mozilla logo and some paragraphs. The paragraph text has
          been styled red by our css." src="img/website-screenshot-styled.png"
          style="display: block; height: 832px; margin: 0px auto; width: 711px;">
          If your paragraph text is red, congratulations! Your CSS is working.

      <p>
        CSS is a rule-based language &mdash; you define rules specifying groups
        of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of
        elements on your webpage. For example "I want the main heading on my page
        to be shown as large red text."</p>
      <p>
        The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve the styling
      described above:</p>
      <code><span class="elements">h1</span> {
      color: <span class="value">red</span>;
      font-size: <span class="value">5em</span>;
    } </code>
    <p>The rule opens with a selector. this selects the HTML elements that we are going
    to style. In this case we are styling level one headings.</p>

    <br>

    <p>We then have a set of curly braces <mark>{ }</mark>. Inside those will be one or more
      <b>declarations</b>, which take the form of <b>property</b> and <b>value</b> pairs.
      Each pair specfies a property of the element(s) we are selecting, then a value that
      we'd like to give the property.</p>

      <br>

      <p>Before the colon, we have the property, and after the colon, the value. CSS properties
        have different allowable values, depending on which property is being specified.
        In our example, we have the <mark>color</mark> property, which can take various
        color values. We also have the <mark>font-size</mark> property. This property can take various
        size units as a value.</p>

        <br>

        <p>
          A CSS stylesheet will contain many such rules, written one after the other.</p>
          <code><span class="elements">h1</span> {
      color: <span class="value">red</span>;
      font-size: <span class="value">5em</span>;
    }

<span class="elements">p</span> {
      color: <span class="value">black</span>;
    }</code>
